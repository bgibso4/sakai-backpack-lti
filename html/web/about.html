                            Open Badges are an excellent way of communicating skills and achievements towards your peers and future employers. <br><br>
                            Visually, Open Badges are simply a digital representation of these skills that you have aquired throughout your life. However under the hood, badges store data that can be verified by anyone at a later date. These badges extend beyond report cards and transcripts as you can take them with you throughout your entire life, updating and and advancing them as you go.<br><br>
                            This Backpack allows you to easily view all of your badges that you have placed in your Mozilla Backpack inside of OWL. From here you can share these badges with other students, professors, and your Linkedin profile.
